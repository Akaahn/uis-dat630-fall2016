Practicum general information
=============================

The exercises are all in Python 3.5.
It is recommended that you work on your own PC. Download and install the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), this includes all the packages we will need.

## Workflow for each task:

  1. Download the exercise file(s) from GitHub
    - If you cloned the entire repository, then do a pull ("sync") and copy the source files to a different folder. Do not make changes under the clone of the repository as this will result in conflicts.
  2. Solve the exercise by editing either
    - a) The `.py` file, if you are using a text editor or IDE
    - b) The `ipynb` file if you are using Jupiter notebooks. (Navigate to the folder with the ipynb file and type `jupyter notebook` on the command line.)
  3. Compare yours against the "official" solution.

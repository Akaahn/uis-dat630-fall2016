Practicum 6
===========

See [this document](../Practicum.md) for general information about the practicums.

Learning objectives:

  - Term-at-a-time and document-at-a-time scoring
  - Retrieval evaluation metrics

## Task 1. Term-at-a-time scoring

  - Implement term-at-a-time scoring using vector space retrieval with TFIDF term weighting


## Task 2. Document-at-a-time scoring

  - Implement document-at-a-time scoring using vector space retrieval with TFIDF term weighting


## Task 3. Retrieval evaluation, binary relevance

  - Compute retrieval evaluation metrics using binary relevance: P@5, P@10, Average Precision, and Reciprocal Rank
  - Compute the metrics for each query individually, as well as the averages over the entire query set


## Task 4. Retrieval evaluation, graded relevance

  - Compute retrieval evaluation metrics using graded relevance: NDCG@5 and NDCG@10
  - Compute the metrics for each query individually, as well as the averages over the entire query set
